All Pages on the website have:

- A responsive navigation bar at the top which allows the user to navigate through the site.

     - A Highlights Section. This section contains an unordered list with some of the main offerings of the retreat. There is also a button labeled “Find out more” which takes you to the about page.

     - A section that goes into more detail as to what the retreat offers and the benefits of Pilates.
     - An image of a lady in a Pilates pose is added to the right of the text to fit in with the description.

      - A sand background image was added to this page to fit in with the theme of the website.

      - A Form consisting of 5 input fields for the users First name, Last name, email address, date of birth, and contact number an additional box was added giving            the user the option to submit any special requests they may have.
         The user must fill in the First 5 input fields in order to submit otherwise a pop up message appears stating  **Please fill out this form**.  
            The user submits the form using the submit button which is titled **Sign up now**. 
- Thank You Page.
   - A brief thanks message to the user letting them know their form has successfully been submitted.

## Skeleton
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Please note the actual website has changed Since these wireframes.
During the building process I decided to Change the home page and added an image as the background as I felt it stood out more as I had not much content on the home page as I did not want it cluttered. I also added a button to link to the about page if the user wanted to find out more.
I also decided to change my about page slightly and added my image opposite the text as I felt it looked better this way.
